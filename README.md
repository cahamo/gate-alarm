# gate-sensor

Project to sense and indicate whether a gate is opened or closed.

Eventually this repository will contain the project's microcontroller source code as it is developed. A description of the project along with details of progress can be found on the [Gate Open Sensor](https://cahamo.delphidabbler.com/projects/gate-sensor/) page of the [Cahamo](https://cahamo.delphidabbler.com) website.
